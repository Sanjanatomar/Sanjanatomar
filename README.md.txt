# NXP-Project-I2C-Master

I2C Master Design Using Verilog

Project Overview

This project implements a single-master I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit) interface in Verilog, simulating a communication protocol widely used for efficient, low-pin communication between various integrated circuits. The design includes an I2C master, capable of both transmitting and receiving data, tested in a simulation environment using ModelSim.

Features

- Single-Master I2C Communication: Supports a bi-directional data line (SDA) and a serial clock line (SCL) to facilitate data exchange between the master and slave devices.
- Finite State Machine (FSM) Design: Operates in distinct states, from initialization to read/write and termination conditions.
- Verilog Implementation: Written in Verilog HDL for RTL simulation and synthesis, allowing for FPGA deployment.
- Simulation & Verification: Simulated in ModelSim, tested for correct data transfers and response from the slave.

Repository Contents

1. `I2C_Master_Dut.v`: The Verilog file containing the design of the I2C master.

2. `I2C_tb.v`: The testbench for simulating and verifying the I2C master's functionality.

3. `IEEE REPORT OF I2C MASTER.pdf`: A detailed IEEE-format report describing the design, methodology, and simulation results of the I2C master.

Design Methodology

The I2C master is designed with a series of states to facilitate communication:

1. Ready: Initial state, awaiting an enable signal.
2. Start: Initiates communication by pulling SDA low while SCL is high.
3. Address: Sends the slave address, selecting the device to communicate with.
4. Acknowledge: Waits for acknowledgment from the addressed slave.
5. Read/Write: Transmits or receives an 8-bit data packet depending on the operation mode.
6. Stop: Ends the communication by pulling SDA high while SCL is high.

Key Functional Details

- Start and Stop Conditions: Signals the beginning and end of data transfer.
- Clock Control: Master generates the clock signal on SCL.
- Slave Addressing: A unique address for each slave device on the bus.
- Collision Detection: Arbitration to handle potential conflicts in multi-master setups.

Simulation Results

Simulations in ModelSim validate the design's functionality across various scenarios, confirming that the master accurately initiates, transfers, and terminates communication as per the I2C protocol.

Synthesis

The design has been synthesized on Xilinx FPGA using Xilinx 14.1, with RTL and Technology schematic outputs included in the report. This enables verification on hardware for further testing and deployment.

Future Scope

The current design can be extended to support multiple masters or additional communication protocols, addressing increased system complexity and device interconnections.

Getting Started

Prerequisites

- ModelSim for simulation
- Xilinx 14.1 or later for synthesis (if FPGA implementation is intended)

Steps to Run

1. Simulation: Use `I2C_tb.v` in ModelSim to verify the design.
2. Synthesis (Optional): Load `I2C_Master_Dut.v` into Xilinx for synthesis on FPGA.
